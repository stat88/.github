# Data C88S

In this connector course we will state precisely and prove results discovered while exploring data in [Data C8](https://www.data8.org/). Topics include: probability, conditioning, and 
independence; random variables; distributions and joint distributions; expectation, variance, tail bounds; Central Limit Theorem; symmetries in random permutations; prior and posterior 
distributions; probabilistic models; bias-variance tradeoff; testing hypotheses; correlation and the regression model.
